# Location of serial port on Raspberry Pi system
uart_0: /dev/ttyS0
uart_2: /dev/ttyAMA2

# Writer's NOTE
# The Raspberry pi 4b has 5 Uart lines.
# NAME  | TYPE
#_______|_____
# UART0 | PL011
# UART1 | mini UART 
# UART2 | PL011
# UART3 | PL011
# UART4 | PL011
# UART5 | PL011
# NOTE: Each uart has 4 pins assign to it. The first to are TX and RX and the last two are for multi device uart. 
# mini uart does not work with the interface I have set up. However, it would be possible to figure out how to make it work.
# In order to see what pins the uart is using run the following command 'dtoverlay -h uart2'. 
# In order to use the additional uart you first need to enable it, by doing the following. 
#   first: add it to the '/boot/config.txt' try running  vim /boot/config.txt, or nano /boot/config.txt, then add the correct line 
#       to the bottom of the config.txt. It should look something like this dtoverlay=UART3
# Then reboot the pi.
# Then check the /dev/ folder for the new serial over lay. It will probably be something like '/dev/ttyAMA3' or '/dev/ttyS3'. 
# One you find the correct path, that is the path you should pass in to our serial class. (see uart_2 or uart_0)
